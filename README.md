**INSTALLATION**

The csv, networkx, community, itemgetter, pandas and numpy libraries must be installed. Specifically from Networkx, version == 2.4 should be obtained as mentioned at the beginning of the notebook Network_Analysis.ipynb.

**MOTIVATION OF THE PROJECT**

What motivated me to carry out this project is that I have experience in the application of network models (Network Analysis), but I wanted to innovate in terms of the field where these types of models are generally applied and that can be of great help for financial institutions. For this I created a "fictitious" transaction database where under that data set I answered the following questions:

1. Are the Network Analysis models applicable to finance issues?
2. Can representative behaviors of people be extracted under Network Analysis models?
3. Are there methodologies to find the main actors in the network analysis?

**FILE DESCRIPTION**

1. There is 1 notebook called "Network_Analysis.ipynb" where you will find the step-by-step treatment of the data and the implementation of the models that allowed me to answer each of the questions. It should be noted that the notebook is commented line by line of what is done in each step.
2. The "fictitious" data set that I created has the name "DATANETWORKANALYSIS.txt", this data set contains 500,000 records and 4 columns such as: "Id_origin" (id of the person who sends money), "Id_destination "(id of the person who receives money)," USD "(total sent in dollars) and" Qtrx "(number of transactions between source id and destination id).

**RESULTS**

The answers to each of the questions posed can be found in the following link

**LICENSE, AUTHORS, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS**

The data being fictitious can be used without any problem. However, if you make use of the data or methodologies, do not hesitate to quote me in the stories, documents, articles or other publication, since they are my authorship.
